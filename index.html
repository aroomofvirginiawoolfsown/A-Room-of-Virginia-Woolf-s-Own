      “A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.”
      <br>— <em>Virginia Woolf, <span class="book-title">A Room of One’s Own</span></em>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong><em>Virginia Woolf (1882 – 1941)</em></strong> was one of the foremost figures of English literary modernism — a novelist, essayist, and publisher whose life and works reshaped twentieth-century ideas of art, gender, and consciousness. Born into a prominent intellectual family in London, she grew up surrounded by books, debates, and the early currents of feminism. Her home later became the center of the Bloomsbury Group, a circle of writers, artists, and thinkers who challenged Victorian conventions and redefined modern art and philosophy.</p>
           <p>Woolf’s writing career began at the Hogarth Press, which she co-founded with her husband Leonard Woolf in 1917. Through this small independent press she published not only her own works but also experimental texts by T.S. Eliot, Freud, and Katherine Mansfield — making the Press itself an emblem of avant-garde literary culture.</p>
          <p>Her major novels — <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> (1925), <em>To the Lighthouse</em> (1927), <em>Orlando</em> (1928), and so many others — revolutionized narrative form with interior monologue and fluid time. Each work explores the subtle layers of human perception and the constraints imposed by gender, society, and history.</p>

                   <ul>
            <li><em>Mrs Dalloway</em>, set in post-war London, unfolds in a single day and probes the inner lives of ordinary citizens beneath the surface of urban routine.</li>
            <li><em>To the Lighthouse</em> reflects the memory of Woolf’s childhood summers in St Ives, translating personal loss into a meditation on art and transience.</li>
            <li><em>Orlando</em> playfully defies gender and time, inspired by her relationship with Vita Sackville-West, becoming a celebration of identity’s fluidity.</li>
            <li>In <em>A Room of One’s Own</em>, Woolf transformed her Cambridge lectures into a manifesto for women’s intellectual independence — the foundation of feminist literary criticism.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Yet behind this creative brilliance lay an ongoing struggle with mental illness. Between periods of intense productivity and silence, Woolf’s diaries reveal both vulnerability and resilience, her acute sensitivity to the modern world’s chaos. In 1941, amid the turmoil of World War II, she took her own life near her home in Rodmell, Sussex, leaving behind a body of work that continues to inspire and challenge readers.</p>
          <p>Virginia Woolf’s influence transcends literature; she stands as both writer and symbol — of modern consciousness, of feminist thought, and of the intertwined beauty and fragility of the creative mind.</p>

<!-- THEORETICAL MODEL -->
<!-- ============================= -->
<h2 id="theoretical-model">Theoretical Model</h2>

<p class="meta-intro">
  The project models the literary universe around the English writer <em>Virginia Woolf</em> as a network of interconnected entities, including people, works, places, publishers, adaptations, and visual resources. Each entity is described according to existing metadata standards adopted by the cultural heritage institutions holding the items.
</p>

<p class="meta-intro">
  Each work (e.g. <em>To the Lighthouse</em>, <em>Mrs Dalloway</em>) has attributes such as title, creator, publication year, publisher, and related locations of creation and content. The project introduces one custom property <code>woolf:hasManuscript</code> to link works with their digital manuscripts (<code>edm:WebResource</code>). The manuscripts are connected only to the works, and each page includes its own description and external digital link. In the case of the diaries, this project treats the entire diary as a collection, while the 1928 diary is selected as a specific manuscript to be annotated in detail. Places are linked to external authorities (Wikidata, GeoNames) via <code>owl:sameAs</code>, and those works linked to the places they were created or their content happened in through <code>schema:contentLocation</code> or <code>schema:locationCreated</code>. Visual materials (portraits, facsimiles) use <code>foaf:depicts</code> to connect with the person entity. Adaptations such as <em>The Hours</em> (film) or <em>From the Diaries of Virginia Woolf</em> (music composition) are connected to the original works through <code>schema:basedOn</code> or <code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code>. <em>From the Diary of Virginia Woolf</em> is linked to the entire diary collection.
</p>

<p class="meta-intro">
  The model therefore integrates literary, biographical, and geographical information through Linked Open Data, reusing vocabularies such as <code>schema.org</code>, <code>Dublin Core Terms</code>, <code>FOAF</code>, <code>PROV</code>, <code>EDM</code>, and <code>GEO</code>. Its conceptual structure is further represented in the Graffoo diagram and in RDF/OWL serializations (<code>woolf-full.rdf</code>, <code>woolf-full.ttl</code>).

  <h2>Knowledge Representation</h2>

  <p class="meta-intro">
    This section introduces the technical implementation of the data creation process when setting the theme as Virginia Woolf and building the ontology based on Virginia Woolf–related items, from collecting resources to text encoding, representing, and organizing.
  </p>

  <!-- ===== XML/TEI ===== -->
  <h2 id="xml-tei">XML / TEI</h2>
  <p class="meta-intro">
    For each item chosen, we encoded them as XML documents employing the <em>TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)</em> standard. Beyond the encoding of excerpt texts from certain important works of Virginia Woolf, we also marked images, places, musical works, and movies to build a diverse and holistic representation of Woolf’s life and her continuing cultural impact.
  </p>
  <p class="meta-intro">
    Here you can find the <a href="https://github.com/SinerYuu/ISCH-A-Room-of-Virginia-Woolf-s-Own-/tree/main/data/tei" target="_blank">XML/TEI documents</a>.
  </p>

<h2 id="rdf">RDF</h2>
<p class="meta-intro">
  We designed an automatic pipeline to convert TEI metadata into RDF triples using the Python library <code>rdflib</code>. A JSON mapping defines the correspondence between TEI tags and RDF predicates, ensuring consistency accross different item types. Additionally, each entity’s set of triples was exported into individual CSV tables for easier inspection.
</p>
<p class="meta-intro">
  Here you can find the 
  <a href="https://github.com/SinerYuu/ISCH-A-Room-of-Virginia-Woolf-s-Own-/blob/main/output/woolf-full.rdf" target="_blank">RDF</a> 
  and 
  <a href="https://github.com/SinerYuu/ISCH-A-Room-of-Virginia-Woolf-s-Own-/blob/main/output/woolf-full.ttl" target="_blank">TTL</a> 
  files of our ontology. The full ontology is also showcased as a Graffoo image, which can be found in the 
  <a href="#conceptual-map">Conceptual Map</a> section.
</p>

  <!-- ===== HTML / XSLT ===== -->
  <h2 id="xslt-html">HTML (via XSLT)</h2>
  <p class="meta-intro">
    In order to facilitate improved accessibility, readability, and interoperability within web environments, this project employs <em>XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)</em> to convert XML-encoded data into a structured and visually coherent HTML document. The XSLT stylesheet functions as a transformation layer that interprets the semantic structure of the XML source and systematically maps its hierarchical elements into corresponding HTML components.
  </p>
  <p class="meta-intro">
    Through this process, the transformation not only preserves the logical organization and metadata of the original XML document but also enhances its usability by rendering the content in a web-compatible and human-readable format. Specific stylistic rules and layout conventions defined within the XSLT document govern the presentation of textual and structural features, ensuring consistency across digital representations.
  </p>
